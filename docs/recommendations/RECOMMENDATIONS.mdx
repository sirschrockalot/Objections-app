- **Trust/Objection** (Don't trust wholesalers, assignment concerns)
- **Property/Objection** (Needs work, neighborhood, photos)
- **Financial/Objection** (Not liquid, lender issues, closing costs)
- **Interest/Objection** (Not interested, waiting for better)

#### 2.2 Difficulty Levels
- **Beginner**: Common, straightforward objections
- **Intermediate**: More nuanced objections requiring deeper understanding
- **Advanced**: Complex objections requiring multiple response strategies
